These are some programs/algorithms I worked on. 


Here is a breakdown of the algorithms:
C: 
All the c programs here are just for the purpose of familiarising myself with the C syntax.

Python/Neural Net:
This was a project I abandoned. I was following a tutorial on YouTube about neural networks in Python.

Python/checkPrime:
This program check whether an inputted number is a prime number or not. It was a coding problem I solved.

Python/coinFlipper:
A program that I developed to show that as the number of coin flips increase, the ratio of heads to tails approachs 50-50.

Python/fib:
A program that prints the fibonacci sequence (not sure if it works correctly)


Python/fizzbuzz:
A solution to the famous fizzbuzz problem. I followed a tutorial to learn this.

Python/LOGIN:
A simple program that asks for a username and password. Made on my own.

Python/password Generator:
A program that generates a randomised password for the user, with a length that the user wants. Made on my own after learning about randomisation in Python.

Python/Pong:
Followed a YouTube tutorial to make PingPong in Python.

Python/y = x_squared + 2x - 8.py:
A script I made in Grade 9 to solve my Maths homework instead of manually solving the y value for specific x values based on an equation.
